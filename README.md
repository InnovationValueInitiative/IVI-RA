# IVI-RA
`iviRA` is an R package that runs the Innovation and Value Initiative's (IVIs) cost-effectiveness model for rheumatoid arthritis. The IVI-RA model is an individual patient simulation (IPS) written mostly in C++ so that it can be run in a reasonable amount of time. The model is flexible and reflects a range of plausible structural assumptions and perspectives (e.g. health care sector, societal). Parameter uncertainty is quantified using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
