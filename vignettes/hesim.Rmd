`hesim` is an R package for health economic simulation modeling and decision analysis. More information about `hesim` can be found on the package [website](https://hesim-dev.github.io/hesim/).

`hesim` interacts with the `iviRA` package in two ways.

1. `hesim` can be used to analyze simulation output produced by the IVI-RA model (e.g., (individualized) cost-effectiveness analysis).

2. The IVI-RA model uses `R` code from `hesim` to sample parameters from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and `C++` [code](https://github.com/hesim-dev/hesim/blob/master/inst/include/hesim_RcppExports.h) from `hesim` in the individual patient simulation.
