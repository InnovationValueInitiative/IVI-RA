This "Run the model" tutorial described how to use the model to peform a cost-effectiveness analyis. To begin, install the package and load it into R.

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("InnovationValueInitiative/IVI-RA")
library(iviRA)
```
The model can then be used for cost-effectiveness analysis by following these 6 steps:

1. Generate patient population.
2. Sample model parameters.
3. Simulate disease progression using the IPS
4. Simulate utility and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)
5. Simulate health-care costs and productivity losses.
6. Analyze the output and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis.
