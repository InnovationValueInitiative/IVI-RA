library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("InnovationValueInitiative/IVI-RA")
library(iviRA)
```
The model can be simulated and used to assess the value of a health technology by following these 5 steps:

2. Sample model parameters.
3. Choose a model structure.
4. Simulate disease progression, mortality, and costs using the IPS.
5. Analyze the output.
