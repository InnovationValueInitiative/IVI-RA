Trial Inclusion Criteria,Exclusion Criteria,Additional Notes and Assumptions
"Trials that permitted up to 20% tDMARD experienced patients in their population as determined by either demographic information, study inclusion criteria, or both.","Trials with only one arm meeting the specified cutoff for prior tDMARD exposure were ineligible. For example, if 19% of Arm X's patients were previously exposed to tDMARDs, and 23% of Arm Y's patients were previously exposed, this trial was deemed ineligible for the network meta-analysis.","Trials that prohibited specific tDMARD treatments, specific tDMARD drug classes, or both were considered to be tDMARD naïve (e.g. Participants were excluded if they received prior TNF inhibitor treatment), unless it was explicitly stated that at least some participants had been previously exposed to other tDMARD agents. This assumption does not include trials that only excluded prior treatment with one or more of the drugs being investigated in the trial. Trials were included in the network if the publication specified up to 20% exposure to any tDMARD agent, a specific tDMARD drug or drug class (such as TNF inhibitors), or both within the study protocol or demographics (e.g. up to 20% of participants could have received prior TNFi treatment or 15% of arm A and 17% of arm B received prior TNFi treatment)."
